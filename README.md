# Welcome!

## Welcome to Lunar Assistant

Welcome to Lunar Assistant! Here you'll find all the documentation you need to get up and running with the Lunar Assistant Discord Bot.

Lunar Assistant is a Discord bot that helps with the community management of NFT communities across multiple blockchains. **** Quickly set up NFT community voting, private channels for those with certain types of NFTs, and public whitelists for mints.

## Core Features

* Manage discord communities based on the contents of discord user wallet addresses.
* Support for multiple user wallets across multiple blockchains.
* Declare rules for automatically assigning roles based on the contents of discord user wallet addresses. The possibilities are endless, but a common use case is to create private channels that only users with specified wallet holdings have access to.
* Plug and play crypto whitelisting based on Discord's KYC process (Coming Soon). Don't reinvent the wheel :)
